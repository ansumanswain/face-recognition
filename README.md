# face-recognition
Face recognition project using OpenCV, Haarcascade, and a CNN. Includes data collection, preprocessing, training, and real-time recognition through an IP Webcam.
Complete Face Recognition Pipeline:

📸 collect_data.py – Capture 100 face samples per user from IP Webcam

🧹 consolidated_data.py – Resize, grayscale, normalize, and label image data

🧠 Training Notebook – Build & train face recognition CNN model

🔍 recognize.py – Real-time recognition using trained model

🧰 haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – Face detection

📦 final_model.h5 – Trained neural network

A fully working ML project that demonstrates data collection → preprocessing → model training → deployment.
